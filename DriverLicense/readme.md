Driver's License Assignment
---------------------------

[view code](src/DriverLicense.java)

For this assignment we will create a class that represents a driver's license.

### [](https://java.austincodingacademy.com/_book/lesson09/driver-license.html#requirements)Requirements

1.  Create a `DriversLicense` Java project with two classes, `DriversLicense` and `LicenseProgram`.

2.  The `DriversLicense` class must include the following attributes:

    -   First Name
    -   Last Name
    -   DOB
    -   Height
    -   Gender

3.  Your `DriversLicense` class should have a `getFullName()` method that returns the full name by concatenating the first name and the last name attributes.

4.  Your `DriversLicense`class should have a `getAge()` method that returns the age by based on the DOB attribute.

5.  You'll use the `LicenseProgram` class to run your program and create DriversLicense instances.
    -   The `LicenseProgram` class will contain one `main` method (and nothing else).
    -   When run, `LicenseProgram` should create three different instances of a DriversLicense and print out the full name and age on each license.

6. Include comments in your code. At the minimum, include a comment for each method to explain what it does. If you submit code without any comments, 5 points will be subtracted from your assignment score.
