# Tic Tac Toe Assignment

[view code](src/TicTacToe.java)

For this assignment we will create a program that will allow 2 users to play tic tac toe.

**Requirements**

Your program should:

1.  Print the initial board
2.  Print which player's turn it is (X or O)
3.  Ask the player for slot position (1 through 9) or (row and column):
    *   if the position is available mark the entry for the player.
    *   if the position is not available ask the player to try again
4.  Print the updated board
5.  Once a player chooses a position:
    *   if the player won, print the winning player
    *   if the game is a tie, print the game is a tie
    *   otherwise, repeat starting at #2
6.  If the game is a tie, or a player won, end the game.

**Guidelines:**

1.  Your implementation should be broken down into different methods.
2.  Each method should have a well defined "job".
