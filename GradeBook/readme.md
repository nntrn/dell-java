Gradebook Assignment
----------------------

[view code](src/GradeBook.java)

For this assignment we will be creating a simple gradebook program.

Requirements: 

1.  Your program should ask the user to input the total number of students in the gradebook.
2.  Your program should ask the user to input each student's name, and a list of grades for that student (as a comma-separated string).
3.  Your program should print out each student's name and the average grade for that student.

Guidelines:

1.  Your program should store the students and the associated grades (as a comma-separated string) in a `Map<String,String>`
2.  Your program should compute the average grade for each student, and create a new `Map<String,Double>` that stores the students and their corresponding grade average.
3.  Use the `Map<String,Double>` that contains the students and their average grade to retrieve and print out the results.
4.  When implementing your solution, use helper methods and include comments in your code.
